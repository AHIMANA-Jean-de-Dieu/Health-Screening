<h1 class="jd">FASTING</h1><p>The purpose of fasting is to achieve accurate results for your blood test for glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and certain ultrasound procedures.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Please fast for at least 8 hours before your appointment.</li>
	<li>No food or beverages are allowed during the fast. However, you can have plain water. We will provide light refreshments after your assessment.</li>
	<li>The average screening duration ranges from 1.5 â€“ 3 hours depending on the selected package.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="viva">GENERAL</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Please do not consume your routine medication or supplements until the fasting tests are over. You can have them right after the test.</li>
	<li>For women, the pap smear, urine and stool tests should be done at least 5 days before or after your menstruation cycle.</li>
</ul>
